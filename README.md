csgosl is a graphical user interface for a [Counter Striker Global Offensive server](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Dedicated_Servers) (CSGO server from now on).  csgosl supports one-click install, update, start and stop server on windows and linux platforms ([supported platforms](https://github.com/lenosisnickerboa/csgosl/wiki/Platform-support)). If you just want your own CSGO server up and running in no time this is the place for you. csgosl provides a graphical user interface supporting most mainstream server options.

* Easily [view](Help-on-Maps) and select all installed maps using map previews
* Greatly simplified server settings with reasonable defaults
