# csgosl

csgosl is a graphical user interface for a [Counter Striker Global Offensive server](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Dedicated_Servers) (CSGO server from now on).  csgosl supports one-click install, update, start and stop server on windows and linux platforms ([supported platforms](https://github.com/lenosisnickerboa/csgosl/wiki/Platform-support)).
